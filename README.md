# Data-Mining-Project
This repository contains the code and pdf file for our Data Science final project. The project is attempts to create data-based recommendations for public schools. Using survey data from the National Household Education Survey, we transformed the dataset into a format accepted by quantitative techniques using principal component analysis. Then, we based recommendations of our fitted random forest model.

Enjoy :)
