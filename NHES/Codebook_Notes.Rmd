Jackknife replicate weights - A replication method known as the jackknife is used to estimate the variance of statistics derived from the full sample. This type of replication involves repeatedly selecting portions of the sample (replicates) and calculating the desired statistic (replicate estimates). The variability among the calculated replicate estimates is then used to obtain the variance of the full-sample estimate.

Seems like we should focus on public schools (Item 2A)

There is observations who are at university/ community college (Item 2G)

I do not think we are focusing on homeschooling so maybe we elimate all of those variables.
-	After 2G to position 116

117-118 about using extra classes outside of physical instruction.

209-210 Is the school your child(ren) go to assigned by the district?
211-212 charter school

ITEM 33: magnet school
ITEM 34: moved to current neighborhood to attend school (may not be relevant)

ITEM 39 talks about how the parents found out about the current school their child is in. Maybe could talk about if that is an effect.

Item 41: been at the same school since the beginning of the yrat.
Item 42: how many hours a week the child attends school.

Item 44 talks about being enrolled in online courses, which I do not think is relevant.
-	Maybe im wrong 45 – 49 talk about whether the school or another higher education institution teaches these students, which could influence parents to push their children to take more course for college credit.
Item 50: does the student enjoy school? Seems. Crucial

Item 51: what lettergrades are made on average

Item 52 and 53 talk about how many times the school has contacted this particular house for various reasons.

Item 54 number of absenet days for student

Item 55 – has student repeated any grades since kindergarden

Item 57 – has the student had a “bad ” punishment
Item 58 – how well does your student do in school

Item 60-64 has the parent been involved/ communicated with the school and are the parents satisfied with the school.

Item 65 – 71 – feelings about homework

72-74 – sooooo does your kid have experiences outside of school.

74-81 deal with health and potential disabilities.

82-84 what month was student born and other birth information

85 – Is the childe Hispanic?

86 – racial questions

87 – gender identity (needs to add more than just male and female)

88 – where does child live

90 – what language does the child speak at home (might be biased)

91 – english second language class.

92 - 93 – number of people on household based on familial relationship

94 – relation to child

95 – 102 – who lives with guardian and what language do they speak.

103 – 136 – demographic information about parents

137 – income assistance programs

138 – household income

Position 665 – parent education

The next number – detailed list of child race and ethnicity.

669 – internet access

686 – questionnaire only in English and Spanish



### Immediate Thoughts
You were right, the survey is only produced in English and Spanish which leaves out a significant number of communitites of color. I also noticed that the gender variable in binary with no option for other gender identities outside of male or female. 

I think we can outright exclude the homeschooled variables since we are aiming for other schools.

Things on the chopping block:
home school variables - adds layers of case-by-case complexity that are too much to deal with.

letter grade variable for outcome of interest instead of parents perception

Throw out parents satisfaction with school except for school reaching out 
- perhaps interact with languages spoken at home!!!!

Potential compression for parent variables 

### Potential Project Structure
1. The problem we wish to address is low parent and family interaction and it's role in student success. To address this problem we plan on predicting student success using variables from the PFI national survey.

2. Dataset we are using and our reasoning behind cleaning it.

3. Random Forest, variable importance plot, variable dependence plots.

4. Model analysis.

5. Recommendations based for programs to be created in schools based on model anaylsis.

6. Critique and recommendation for the PFI national survey.

7. Conclusion.

### Action steps
- Hannah is looking into weighting methodology.

#### Weighting Methodology:
- The weights were constrained such that the distribution of the NHES ECPP and PFI estimates matched
selected population estimates from the 2018 American Community Survey (ACS). Although NHES used
Current Population Survey (CPS) estimates for control totals in administrations prior to 2012, the ACS
was used beginning with NHES:2012 because it has a larger sample size than the CPS, allowing for more
accurate control totals and greater precision in the NHES person-level estimates.

-  Information from the first phase (screening to see if have kids of right age) was used to create the householdlevel weights. 
-  The household base weight (HBWj) was calculated first to account for the differential sampling of addresses based on the race/ethnicity stratum of the frame. 
-  The household-level base weight was then adjusted for screener nonresponse using the screener noninterview adjustment factor (SNIAFj)
-  The final household-level weight for household j, HHWj, is given by
HHWj = HBWj*SNIAFj where HBWj is the household-level base weight for household j.

- Joey is looking further into relevant CPA uses.


### 04/27 Meeting:

- Trimmed data alot 
--remove homeschool, online school, non-sampled kids, weighting and imputation data

-Consider feature engineering for other ppl in the household

- Run random forest on SEGRADES vs all 275 variables

- Variable importance plot to further trim variables

- Should we combine all of the location indicators


#### THINGS TO LOOK AT:
- Impact of out-of-school activities (art, zoo, sports, etc) on grades (outcome)
- Impact of language, SES, # of parents, parents ed, etc. on kid outcomes
- Impact of type of school

Desired conclusion--
- Want to draw some conclusion around how parent involvement/engagement in student's lives impact outcomes
-- how is this biased
- Based on assumption of limited access/resources, what is the most impactful to invest in/prioritize for 
families that are not/cannot be as involved or engage in traditional manner
- how to distribute financial burden of involvement (after isolating reason for non-involvement)
- Recommendations for how survey can be more inclusive
